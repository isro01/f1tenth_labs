# Lab 4: Follow the Gap

Navie approach (w/o disparity extender) : [YouTube](https://youtu.be/T6ruh91sU0M)

The failures in map 2 might be due to wiggling and choosing the wrong gap. Maybe some more preprocessing might help. The uturn at the top right seems impossible to do even with slowest speed and max trning angle.
